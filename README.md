# WiFi Password Finder Script

## Introduction

This Python script helps you retrieve the WiFi passwords for networks that were previously connected to your system. If youâ€™ve forgotten your WiFi password, this script can recover it for networks you've connected to in the past.

**Note:** The script only works for WiFi networks that have been connected to the system before. It will not work for unknown or nearby WiFi networks.

## Prerequisites

- Python (any version 3.x should work)
- No external libraries are required, as the script uses Python's built-in `subprocess` module.

## How It Works

The script runs two terminal commands to fetch the WiFi profiles and their associated passwords:

1. **`netsh wlan show profiles`**: Lists all WiFi networks your system has connected to.
2. **`netsh wlan show profile PROFILE-NAME key=clear`**: Retrieves the password for a specific network.

### Code Explanation

- The script first retrieves the list of WiFi profiles from your system.
- It then runs the second command for each profile to find the associated password.
- The password, if available, is displayed alongside the network name.

```python
import subprocess

# Running command to get WiFi profiles
command = subprocess.check_output(['netsh', 'wlan', 'show', 'profiles']).decode('utf-8').split('\n')
profiles = [i.split(":")[1][1:-1] for i in command if "All User Profile" in i]

# Loop through profiles and retrieve passwords
for i in profiles:
    results = subprocess.check_output(['netsh', 'wlan', 'show', 'profile', i, 'key=clear']).decode('utf-8').split('\n')
    results = [b.split(":")[1][1:-1] for b in results if "Key Content" in b]
    
    # Display the profile name and password (if available)
    try:
        print ("{:<30}|  {:<}".format(i, results[0]))
    except IndexError:
        print ("{:<30}|  {:<}".format(i, ""))
input("")
